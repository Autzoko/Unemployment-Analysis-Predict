# Big Data Final Project

**U.S. State Unemployment Rate Analysis and Prediction Platform**

## Deploy
```bash
bash deploy.sh
```
This app will build three containers to run backend, frontend, and the database(MongoDB) locally. After deploy, visit http://localhost:8080 to check!

## Project File Structure
- dataset: raw data, processed data, and predict data generated by prediction model.
- predict: ARIMA model, for prediction uses.
- tools: python scripts to convert data format and upload data to MongoDB.
- web
  - frontend: web app frontend, using Vue.js framework.
  - backend: web app backend, using FastAPI frameworl.

## Demo
Demo illustrations.

### For Dev Uses

- To process raw data, run: ```python to_csv.py```, processed data will be generated under `./processed`. For each different *series_id* in state data, they are generated separatedly for different purposes.
- To upload processed data to local (or remote) repository, run ```python repository/upload_mongodb.py```, data will be uploaded to **MongoDB**. All auxiliary data will be stored in *basic_data* collection, data of different states will be stored in *state* collections accordingly.
